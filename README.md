# Godot FPS Tutorial (in C#)

## Notes

* The goals of the tutorial were **accomplished up to part 4\***.
* Some settings were adjusted for personal preference, like for example:
    * Overall physics speed (walk/run/jump speed and gravity, matching the likes of a "basic Quake")
    * Animation speeds, affecting weapons' fire rate, switching and reloading.
    * (Probably a bit more, but I don't remember at this point...)
* Some sounds used for the tutorial are from [gamesounds.xyz](https://gamesounds.xyz), others are composed MIDI notes I recorded myself
    * There's no `LargeAmmoPack.wav` audio file. Not sure what sound to make for it, feel free to ignore, suggest or fill (as long as they're royalty-free).

> **\***: The joypad code is not included.
